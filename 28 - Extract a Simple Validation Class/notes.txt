In the lesson 27, I learnt:

* Pure Function:
    A function which is not contingent to or dependent on outside values. In 'Validator.php', the 'string()' function is a pure function.
    * Not dependant on internal state of the class i.e. do not use '$this'.
    * Not linked to any other class

    * To call a pure function without using the instance of the class, we can make it static. The static pure function will be accessible without creating the instance of the class

    ' public static function string(){
        // function body
    }'

    can be accessed as Validator::string();

    // A static pure function can be accessed without creating the instance of the class and can be accessed using class name and scope resolution operator ClassName::static_pure_function_name()

* filter_var($value, FILTER_..) function is used to takea variable and filter it
