In the lesson 41, I learnt:

* PHP provides a function that verify a password input by the user against a 'Hashed password' stored in the database:
    password_verify($password, $user['password']);

* Loggin out user:
    -> it should be a post request and rather using an anchor tag, you can use a form.

* To destroy a session's data:
    -> Clear the super-global $_SESSION
        $_SESSION = [];
    -> run the session destroy function to clear the cookie that is stored in the browser
        -> session_destroy();
        -> set a cookie:
            -> setcookie('cookie_name', 'cookie_value', 'expiry_time', 'path', 'domain_name');
