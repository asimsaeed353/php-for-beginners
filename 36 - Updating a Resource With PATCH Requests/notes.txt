In the lesson 36, I learnt:

* Updating a Note using PATCH Requests

* Convention we followed :
    /controllers/notes/
        -> index.php : listing down all notes
        -> create.php : a form for adding a new note to the database record
        -> destroy.php : delete a note
        -> edit.php : form that allows authorized user to edit the note
        -> show.php : show a single note
        -> store.php : storing a note after form submission in create.php
        -> update.php : update the record in the database after user edited a note
