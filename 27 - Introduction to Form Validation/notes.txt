In the lesson 27, I learnt:

* PHP isset Function:
        isset($variable) returns 'true' if the variable has some value and 'false' if variable is NULL.

* how to apply different types of validation checks on form inputs.

* use 'required' attribute in html <textarea> to avoid users inputting empty forms. It is client side validation and can be by-passed using the following command:
 '
 curl -X POST https://localhost:8888/notes/create -d 'body='
'
 Use server-side validation to avoid accepting empty inputs.
* apply validation on lengths of characters a user can input
* for a single input form, there must be multiple validation violations you need to check against.

* reserving form data so user don't have to write everything from all over again in case user inputs invalid form data.

    (i) Old Method to retain the form input even after submitting it
        <textarea>
            <?= isset($_POST['body']) ? $_POST['body'] : '' ?>
        </textarea>

    (ii) Modern Method using 'NULL COALESCING' operator
        <textarea>
                    <?= $_POST['body'] ?? '' ?>
                </textarea>
