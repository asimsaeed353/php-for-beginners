In the lesson 45, I learnt:

* In this project, till yet, when the email or password validation fails, the old form data is lost. LogIn form prompts us to enter email and password again.

* As we flashed the session data ($_SESSION) in previous lesson, we can flash the data in the post request ($_POST) so the email field is not wiped out on failed validation.

* retaining old form data using a function:
    function old($key, $default = '')
    {
        // old() -> helper method which gives you old form data
        return Core\Session::get('old')[$key] ?? $default;
    }
